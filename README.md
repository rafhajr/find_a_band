### Commit

For commit we use Husky, which runs lint and standardizes commit messages. The message must have a type and a message, there are four types ["feature", "chore", "fix", "bugfix"], and the message needs to be lowercase, examples:

```bash
git commit -m 'feature: adding or enhancing existing features'

git commit -m 'chore: code refactoring, updating dependencies, or improving project structure'

git commit -m 'fix: fix details in the code, not necessarily bugs'

git commit -m 'bugfix: fix bugs in the code'
```


### Issues

#### Husky

If pre-commit hooks are not working be sure that you have installed husky: `husky install`.

By default this command should be triggered after yarn/npm deps are installed.
